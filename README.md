# Rock-Paper-Scissors 🪨 🧻 ✂️

## Introduction :eyes: 
This is a single-player game of Rock-Paper-Scissors played against the computer, made in C language.

## How It works :rocket:

 First, the player is prompted for a name, which is saved for use on the scoresheet.

The player is then asked to make a choice between rock, paper and scissors.
This can either be inputted in full as: \
Rock or rock\
Paper or paper\
Scissors or scissors

Or can be abbreviated either in uppercase or in lowercase as:\
r or R\
p or P\
s or S respectively 

The Program then generates a random result (Rock, paper, or scissors) as well and that is compared with your own input to determine the winner.


## The Rules 📜

* Rock vs Paper ==> Paper Wins\
Paper wraps rock

* Rock vs Scissors ==> Rock Wins\
Rock smashes scissors

* Scissors vs Paper ==> Scissors Wins\
Scissors cuts paper

### Scoresheet 📖
